\section{Basics of Hypothesis Test}

  In order to test whether a given coin is fair or not, it is tossed 100 times, and resulted in 45 heads. Does this provides convincing evidence that this coin is not fair?\vspace{0.3cm}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hypotheses}\vspace{0.3cm}

In the above setting, we have two contending \textbf{hypotheses} about the parameter $p$ , where $p$ is the probability of getting a head when this coin is tossed. One hypothesis is $\displaystyle{p=\frac{1}{2}}$, which means the coin is fair. The other one is $\displaystyle{p \ne \frac{1}{2}}$, which means the coin is not fair. The firs hypothesis is called \textbf{null hypothesis}, denoted as $\textbf{H}_0$, and the second one is called \textbf{alternative hypothesis}, denoted as $\textbf{H}_a$. They are written as 
$$\textbf{H}_0:\quad p=\frac{1}{2}$$
$$\textbf{H}_a:\quad p\ne\frac{1}{2}$$
\colorbox{babypink}{\parbox{0.9\textwidth}{
\textbf{Remark:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Usually, the $\textbf{H}_a$ is the hypothesis we want to seek evidence for.
 \item The hypotheses are about parameters. 
You can not set statements like $\reallywidehat{p} = \frac{1}{2}$, $\bar{x} = 0.6$ as hypotheses.
 \end{itemize}
}}
\vspace{0.3cm}

 The \textbf{hypothesis test} is the procedure to make decisions between the two hypotheses.\vspace{0.3cm}

In the above case, if $\textbf{H}_a$ is true, it can either be $p < \frac{1}{2}$ or $p > \frac{1}{2}$. This type of \textit{hypotheses test} is called \textbf{two-sided hypotheses test}.\vspace{0.3cm}

If the hypotheses are set as either of the following

$$\textbf{H}_0:\quad p=\frac{1}{2}, \qquad \textbf{H}_a:\quad p >\frac{1}{2}$$

$$\textbf{H}_0:\quad p=\frac{1}{2}, \qquad \textbf{H}_a:\quad p <\frac{1}{2}$$

the \textit{hypotheses test} is called \textbf{one-sided hypotheses test}.\vspace{0.6cm}

\textbf{Juicy Pineapples}\vspace{0.3cm}

At the Hawaii Pineapple Company, managers are interested in the size of the pineapples grown in the companyâ€™s fields. Last year, the mean weight of the pineapples harvested from one large field was 31 ounces. A  different irrigation system was installed in this field after the growing season.  Managers wonder how this change will affect the mean weight of  pineapples grown in the field this year.\vspace{0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item State appropriate hypotheses for performing a significance test. Be sure to define the parameter of interest.
    \item Is this a \textbf{one-sided} or \textbf{two-sided} hypotheses test?
\end{enumerate}
}}
\newpage





\item \textbf{The reasoning of hypotheses test}\vspace{0.3cm}

Let's use the ``fair coin'' setting and the hypotheses are
$$\textbf{H}_0:\quad p=\frac{1}{2}$$
$$\textbf{H}_a:\quad p\ne\frac{1}{2}$$ 
Among the 100 tosses, 45 are head.\vspace{0.3cm}

How to choose between those two hypotheses? The reasoning is like:   if we assume the \textit{null hypotheses} is true, and we get a sample with the sample proportion $\hat{p}$ far away from $\displaystyle p= \frac{1}{2}$, then we have convincing evidence for $H_a$ and reject $H_0$. \vspace{0.3cm}

\textbf{In the following, $H_0$ is assumed to be true, with $p = 1/2$!!!}\vspace{0.3cm}


How to tell whether $\reallywidehat{p}$ is far away from $p$ or not? We have to resort to the sampling distribution of $\reallywidehat{p}$ when assuming $H_0$ is true. According to what we learned before, if certain conditions are met, $\reallywidehat{p}$ is approximately normally distributed. 
$$\reallywidehat{p} \sim N(\mu_{\reallywidehat{p}}, \sigma_{\reallywidehat{p}}), \qquad \mu_{\reallywidehat{p}} = p, \quad \sigma_{\reallywidehat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$     
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{HypothesisTestSamplingDistribution}
    \caption{$\hat{p}$ that is far away from $p$}
    \label{HypothesisTestSamplingDistribution}
    \end{figure}
    


In figure\ref{HypothesisTestSamplingDistribution}, we draw two lines away from $p$. If a $\reallywidehat{p}$ falls to the outside of those two lines, indicated by the shaded areas, we say this $\reallywidehat{p}$ is far away from $p$.\vspace{0.3cm}

However, where to draw those two lines? Referring to figure\ref{HypothesisTestSamplingDistribution}, if the total area of the ``shaded areas'' are given, then the position of the two lines are decided. We call this given total area \textbf{significance level $\mathbf{\alpha}$}. The most frequently used \textit{significance level} is $\mathbf{\alpha} = 0.05$.

\begin{textblock}{3}(15.5, -4)
\textblockcolor{dollarbill}
Set significance level $\mathbf{\alpha} = 0.05$. Is the $\reallywidehat{p}$ far away from $p$ in the case of ``fair coin'' with $$H_0 = 1/2$$ $$H_1 \ne 1/2$$
\end{textblock}
\vspace{0.3cm}

In the above \textit{two-sided hypotheses}, when $\reallywidehat{p}$ is either way larger or way smaller than $p$, we say $\reallywidehat{p}$ is far away from $p$ in the direction of $H_a$. Because, either ``way larger'' or ``way smaller'' is in favour of $H_a$.\vspace{0.3cm}

How to define ``far away'' in the case of \textit{one-sided hypotheses test}? Use the ``fair coin'' example, and change the hypotheses into 
    $$\textbf{H}_0:\quad p=\frac{1}{2}$$
$$\textbf{H}_a:\quad p\leq \frac{1}{2}$$ 

Since we have to decide whether  $\reallywidehat{p}$ is far away from $p$ in the direction of $H_a$, we have to draw a borderline to the left side of $p$, as shown in figure\ref{OneSidedHT}.    
     \begin{figure}[H]
     \centering
     \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{OneSidedHT}
     \caption{One-sided hypotheses test}
     \label{OneSidedHT}
     \end{figure}
Here, the \textit{significance level} $\mathbf{\alpha}$ is the area to the left side of the borderline demarcating whether $\reallywidehat{p}$ is far away from $p$ or not.

\begin{textblock}{3.6}(-3, -4)
\textblockcolor{dollarbill}
Set significance level $\mathbf{\alpha} = 0.05$. Is the $\reallywidehat{p}$ far away from $p$ in the case of ``fair coin'' with $$H_0 = 1/2$$ $$H_1 \leq 1/2$$
\end{textblock}
\vspace{0.6cm}

In the case of \textit{one-sided hypotheses test} as
    $$\textbf{H}_0:\quad p=\frac{1}{2}$$
$$\textbf{H}_a:\quad p\leq \frac{1}{2}$$ 
everything is argued similarly.\vspace{0.6cm}

\colorbox{babypink}{\parbox{0.9\textwidth}{
\textbf{Remark:}\vspace{0.3cm}

 \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Significance level $\alpha$ is set before the sample is drawn.} 
     \item \textbf{The hypotheses is set before the sample is drawn.}
     \item \textbf{All the above are based on the assumption that $H_0$ is true.}
 \end{itemize}

}}

\newpage

\item \textbf{The p-value}\vspace{0.3cm}

Still use the ``fair coin'' example, and the hypotheses are
$$\textbf{H}_0:\quad p=0.5$$
$$\textbf{H}_a:\quad p\ne0.5$$ 
The sample proportion $\reallywidehat{p} = 45/100 = 0.45$.\vspace{0.3cm}

Assume $H_0$ is correct. The probability 
$\textbf{P}(|\reallywidehat{p}-0.5| > |0.45-0.5|)$ are shown in figure

 \textbf{Calcium and Blood Pressure}\vspace{0.3cm}
 
 Does increasing the amount of calcium in our diet reduce blood pressure? Examination of a large sample of people revealed a relationship between calcium intake and blood pressure. The relationship was strongest for black men. Such observational studies do not establish causation. Researchers therefore designed a randomized comparative experiment.\vspace{0.3cm}
 
 The subjects were 21 healthy black men who volunteered to take part in the experiment. They were randomly assigned to two groups: 10 of the men received a calcium supplement for 12 weeks, while the control group of 11 men received a placebo pill that looked identical. The experiment was doubleblind. The response variable is the decrease in systolic (top number) blood pressure for a subject after 12 weeks, in millimeters of mercury. An increase appears as a negative number. Here are the data:
